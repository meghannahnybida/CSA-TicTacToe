# CSA-TicTacToe
 <h3> Project </h3>
 This project was to create two different tictactoe games: one using multidimensional arrays and one using arraylists.
 
 <h3> MultiDimensional </h3>

  <li> This screenshot displays the screen the user sees when the program is first run (informs user of game markers, 
        shows board layout, and gives an example input).</li>
        
//screenshot  

  <li> This screenshot shows the user in an intense battle against the computer. The AI was written so that it gives 
      the user a run for its money with its placement tracking capability.</li>

  <li> Here you can see the ending message for the game. This time around, the user lost, how embarrassing! You 
      can see how the program is able to track which player won, and give a fitting message depending on the outcome of
      the game. </li>
      
  <h3> ArrayList </h3>
  
  //screenshot
  
  <li> This screenshot shows the opening screen of the arraylist version of the game (informs user of game markers, 
      shows board layout, and gives an example input). </li>
      
  //screenshot
  
  <li> This screenshot displays the user on the verge of winning (but still of course in an intense battle). My favorite
      part about the arraylist version is the AI's "thinking simulation". After a user places an X, the AI waits a couple
      second by using the Thread.sleep() to simulate real life opponent thinking. </li>
      
  //screenshot
  
  <li> This screenshot shows the ending screen for the program. The user won this round, so an appropriate ending message 
      is displayed. The arraylist program uses lists within a String method to check for markers in a winning pattern. If a 
      winning pattern is found, the method returns the fitting String response. </li>
